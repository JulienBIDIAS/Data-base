# Data base

The data set ECON523-Meyersson-data.dta, was first used in the paper “Islamic Rule and the Empowerment of the Poor and Pious” by Erik Meyersson, published in Econometrica in 2014. The paper uses a regression discontinuity design to estimate the impact of Islamic political parties on women’s equality, comparing municipalities where the Islamic party just won the mayoral election in 1994 to those where the Islamic party just lost.

# Introduction 

Meyersson used a method called regression discontinuity design to study how the Islamic
party affects women’s empowerment in Turkey. This means looking at data from Turkish towns
and finding out that the Islamic party has a big impact on empowering women, especially those
who are poor and religious. Meyerson started by giving treatment to some places to see the
real impact. The regression discontinuity design is used because it’s tricky to compare towns
based on the type of mayor they elect. This is not random; towns more likely to pick an Islamic
mayor might also have issues with women’s education for other reasons. So, this method helps
avoid that problem. In this design, towns below a certain point get a regular mayor (control
group), and those above get an Islamic mayor (treatment group), with the winning margin as a
control. Overall, when Turkey elected Islamic mayors through fair voting, it helped women get
more into education and politics. Surprisingly, this didn’t make people more Islamic over time.
This mainly happened in poorer and religious parts of Turkey, showing that it boosted the less
fortunate and religious people.

# Conclusion 

Through Meyersson’s article, I learned a lot about studying the effects of public policies
using a regression discontinuity model. One important thing I got from this study is the positive
impact that municipalities led by the Islamic party, previously criticized for its views on women,
had on empowering and educating women aged 15 to 20. Islamic mayors clearly encouraged
more women to get involved, both in education and politics, without showing strong party preferences.
However, the article also points out a big problem with the way the author studied
things, called the external validity problem. It means that the results should be understood in a
specific context because of the unique nature of Turkish local politics. So, it’s hard to separate
the positive effect of Islamic rule on disadvantaged and religious communities from the things
that make it difficult for them to get involved in the first place. These things show why we need
to be careful in how we study things and really understand the situation when we look at the
results of this analysis.
