# Data base

The data set ECON523-Meyersson-data.dta, was first used in the paper “Islamic Rule and the Empowerment of the Poor and Pious” by Erik Meyersson, published in Econometrica in 2014. The paper uses a regression discontinuity design to estimate the impact of Islamic political parties on women’s equality, comparing municipalities where the Islamic party just won the mayoral election in 1994 to those where the Islamic party just lost.

# Introduction 

Meyersson used a method called regression discontinuity design to study how the Islamic
party affects women’s empowerment in Turkey. This means looking at data from Turkish towns
and finding out that the Islamic party has a big impact on empowering women, especially those
who are poor and religious. Meyerson started by giving treatment to some places to see the
real impact. The regression discontinuity design is used because it’s tricky to compare towns
based on the type of mayor they elect. This is not random; towns more likely to pick an Islamic
mayor might also have issues with women’s education for other reasons. So, this method helps
avoid that problem. In this design, towns below a certain point get a regular mayor (control
group), and those above get an Islamic mayor (treatment group), with the winning margin as a
control. Overall, when Turkey elected Islamic mayors through fair voting, it helped women get
more into education and politics. Surprisingly, this didn’t make people more Islamic over time.
This mainly happened in poorer and religious parts of Turkey, showing that it boosted the less
fortunate and religious people.
